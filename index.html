      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        As a Computer Engineering third-year student at Mugla Sitki Kocman University, my passion for computers began at the age of seven and has since evolved into a deep interest in software development.
        Currently, I am completing my summer internship at S3M, a company specializing in network access control (NAC), cybersecurity tools, and hotspot solutions.
        At S3M, I work on developing system-level utilities that gather system information such as IP configuration, antivirus status, and hardware diagnostics using Swift.
        Alongside my internship, I’m actively working on my personal website, which I built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.
        In parallel, I’m focusing on learning Swift with the goal of developing iOS applications, and I’m currently in the early stages of building an app to deepen my understanding of the iOS ecosystem.
        I am an active member of the IEEE Computer Society, where I engage in knowledge sharing and enhance my social skills.
